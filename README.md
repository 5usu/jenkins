## What I'm Trying to Do 🎯

I've got three datasets full of Jenkins Q&A pairs that I want to use to make GPT-2 better at handling Jenkins-specific questions. Think of it like teaching GPT-2 to be a Jenkins expert! The data comes from:
- Community questions and answers
- Jenkins documentation Q&A pairs
- Updated query results from real users

2. **Setting Up Modal**
   ```bash
   pip install modal
   modal run modalfine.py::finetune
   ```

3. **Getting Your Data Ready**
   I'm using Modal's volume feature to store my datasets. Here's how to set that up:
   ```bash
   modal volume create datasets-volume
   modal volume put datasets-volume your_csv_files/ /data/
   ```

## How My Code Works 🛠️

The main script (`modalfine.py`) does a few key things:

1. **Sets Up the Environment**
   ```python
   app = modal.App("gpt2-finetune")
   ```
   This creates our Modal app and gets everything ready for training.

2. **Handles the Data**
   - Loads my CSV files
   - Combines all the Q&A pairs
   - Gets everything in the right format for training

3. **Trains the Model**(few errors to resolve)
   - Takes GPT-2 and starts teaching it about Jenkins
   - Saves progress along the way
   - Keeps track of how well it's learning


### Smart Data Processing
The code is pretty smart about handling the data - it looks for question and answer columns in different formats:
```python
question_col = 'Question' if 'Question' in examples else 'question'
answer_col = 'Answer' if 'Answer' in examples else 'answer'
```

## Running the Project 🏃‍♀️

It's actually pretty simple to run:
```bash
python jenkins/modalfine.py
```

The script will:
1. Check all your files are in place
2. Start training the model
3. Save the results when it's done

## When Things Go Wrong 😅

Here are some common issues I ran into and how to fix them:

1. **"Can't find the files!"**
   - Double-check your Modal volume setup
   - Make sure your CSV files are actually uploaded

2. **"Column not found" errors**
   - This usually means your CSV columns have different names
   - Check the logging output to see what columns are actually there

3. **Out of Memory**
   - Try reducing the batch size
   - Or increase the gradient accumulation steps

## What I Learned 📚

Building this project taught me a lot about:
- Working with Modal for ML tasks
- Managing large datasets
- Fine-tuning language models
- The importance of good data preprocessing

## Future Improvements 🚀

Things I might add later:
- [ ] Add validation dataset
- [ ] Implement better error handling
- [ ] Add example generation script
- [ ] Create a simple API to query the model
