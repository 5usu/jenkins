## What I'm Trying to Do

I've got three datasets full of Jenkins Q&A pairs that I want to use to make GPT-2 better at handling Jenkins-specific questions. Think of it like teaching GPT-2 to be a Jenkins expert! The data comes from:
- Community questions and answers
- Jenkins documentation Q&A pairs
- Updated query results from real users

2. **Setting Up Modal**
   ```bash
   pip install modal
   modal run modalfine.py::finetune
   ```

3. **Getting Your Data Ready**
   I'm using Modal's volume feature to store my datasets. Here's how to set that up:
   ```bash
   modal volume create datasets-volume
   modal volume put datasets-volume your_csv_files/ /data/
   ```

## How My Code Works

The main script (`modalfine.py`) does a few key things:

1. **Sets Up the Environment**
   ```python
   app = modal.App("gpt2-finetune")
   ```
   This creates our Modal app and gets everything ready for training.

2. **Handles the Data**
   - Loads my CSV files
   - Combines all the Q&A pairs
   - Gets everything in the right format for training

3. **Trains the Model**(few errors to resolve)
   - Takes GPT-2 and starts teaching it about Jenkins
   - Saves progress along the way
   - Keeps track of how well it's learning
